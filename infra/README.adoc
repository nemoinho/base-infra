This project is responsible for providing the required infra to run a kubernetes-cluster.

== Setup

// tag::setup[]
[WARNING]
Make sure `config.auto.tfvars` with all the needed configuration-secrets is present otherwise the module cannot be applied!
The file is savely stored in the password-manager.

[source,bash]
----
terraform init # <1>
terraform apply # <2>
----

<1> Init the terraform modules if necessary
<2> Setup infrastructure and create/update inventory.ini

[WARNING]
The setup will take longer than just the `terraform apply`, since it will install some.
As a rule of thumb wait ca. 5 minutes after the apply to do other work.
// end::setup[]
