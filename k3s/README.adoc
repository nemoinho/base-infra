This project is responsible for setting up a k3s installation.

== Setup

The setup requires a `inventory.ini` this should be provided by a previous step.

// tag::setup[]
[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml # <1>
ansible-playbook site.yml # <2>
----

<1> Install required ansible collections to create a k3s-cluster (can be omitted in subsequent runs)
<2> Install k3s and download kube-config to .kube/config

[IMPORTANT]
The second step will override any existing kube config, this might destroy any existing settings!
// end::setup[]
